# Initiative

Initiative is a Wordpress Plugin that adds the Initiative posttype to wordpress.

Each "User" has one "Initiative" Entry. 

Following features/workflow are included:
* An Initiative can register itself. Then a new user is created.
* The Adminstrator can "approve" (Best√§tigen) the new user. Then the user role will change to "Author" and a new post with the posttype "Initiative" is created.
* Now the User can login and edits its own data and can fill out a discription of his own initiativ.
* Under the User options it is possible to fill in a Feed URL and Feed URL Type. After they filled in the Feed can be added in the user listview with the action "Add/Update Feed". For this the Plugin "Events Syndicatoin Server" have to be activated.
* The Plugin supports that the Initiative will be uploaded to the Map of Tommorow (Karte von Morgen) as an Entry in the map. This works only if the Plugin KVM-Interface is activated.
